# About Me

Hi, I’m Aaron Mooney. I’m an experienced professional with a background in Safety, Ergonomics, and User Interface Design. Although these seem like separate fields, they are a subset of an area called “Human Factors Engineering” – designing systems for humans. 

Testing the effectiveness of interventions is common in each of these areas. While I learned Statistics in my undergraduate and graduate studies, I didn’t get much practice, and didn’t feel confident applying the methods. As a returning student, I’m studying Statistics and Analytics to improve my knowledge and confidence in these areas. 

## My interests

My interests revolve around the process of creating and building useful things. I’ve created many items, both functional and frivolous, ranging from: 
* A website that scores ergonomic risk factors (one of, if not the first of its kind)
* A prototype ‘parrot shower’
* A garage bike lift
* Built-in cabinetry
* A retaining wall.

I've built or designed many more items, but this was just a sample of them.

## Websites I Recommend

[ Internet Movie Database ][def]. 
I enjoy movies and historical series, and for whatever reason, I have a good memory for voices and faces. If I’m watching a program and I encounter a voice or face that seems familiar from another program, I’ll use IMDB.com to investigate.

[ Strawberry Pop-Tart Blow Torches ][def2]. 
Long ago, satirist Dave Barry wrote a book about technology and the internet. What’s memorable about the book was his mention of the first two internet memes. One of them, linked above, was about flaming Strawberry Poptarts. The other, not linked for various reasons, was about Chewbacca’s snack choices. You can find information about that one with a little digging. These are both examples of the wild world of the early internet.
