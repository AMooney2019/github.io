<h1>My name is Aaron Mooney</h1>
<p>I am a student working on refreshment courses in preparation of taking the GRE and applying to a graduate degree program. My goal is to obtain a BioStatistics-related role.</p>
<p>When I'm not studying, I enjoy designing items for manufacture. I'm currently working on the designs for a series of <em>Biology</em> and <em>Chemistry</em> themed earrings. Earrings are a fun design challenge because they are small and delicate; there is little space to communicate iconography, plus they need to be light, balanced, and aesthetic. They are a great project for learning 3d printing and design.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I'm also working on a series of products for home organization -- things I've already created for my own home, that I hope to produce and sell in the future.</p>
<p>When I'm not engaging in those activities, you can find me watching TV, riding my bike, or working in the garage.</p>
